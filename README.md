Documentation
=============

General documentation of the equipment and procedures in the Robotic Surgery Group at Aalborg University.

The documentation is hosted on GitHub, which lets us use MarkDown to describe stuff in natural language, and have code-examples as well. The main prose is located in the [wiki](../../wiki) associated with this repository.

### Project Management
GitHub provides an [issue tracker](../../issues), that we use to assign and keep track of tasks regarding the general system. For more specific code issues, we use the issue trackers of the individual code repositories.
